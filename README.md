## ðŸ”§ Features

- Upload CSV file with numerical features (`time`, `loc`)
- Uses **Isolation Forest** to detect outliers
- Assigns labels:  
  `1` â†’ Normal data  
  `-1` â†’ Anomaly  
- View results in an interactive table
- Download labeled dataset as CSV

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Used

### âœ… Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Learning)
An ensemble-based anomaly detection algorithm. It isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal data.

#### ðŸ§® Anomaly Score Formula:
For a point **x** in a forest of trees **t**, the anomaly score is:

Where:
- **E(h(x))** = average path length of point x
- **c(n)** = average path length of unsuccessful search in a Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **n** = number of samples

Interpretation:
- **Score â‰ˆ 1** â†’ anomaly
- **Score â‰ˆ 0.5** â†’ normal
